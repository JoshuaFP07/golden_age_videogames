## Objectives

In this **guided project** from **Datacamp**, I will analyze video game critics, user scores, and sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I will search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best and will explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I will also filter, group, and order data using.

## Data
I will explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. I compared a dataset on game sales with critics and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown. The database itself contains two tables which it is limited to 400 rows for each table. The complete dataset is on Kaggle with over 13,000 games. 

Dataset source = https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata

## Tools
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and documentation
- SQL for querying and data manipulation

## Closing
I appreciate your interest in my project repository. I am open to any feedback, suggestions, or critiques you want to give me as it will increase my documentation skills for my newer projects and my analytical skills on data.
