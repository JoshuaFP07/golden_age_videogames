# When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

## Objectives

In this **guided project**, I will analyze video game critics, user scores, and sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I will search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and will explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I will also filter, group, and order data using 

### Data
We will explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critics and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown. The database itself contains two tables which it is limited to 400 rows for each table. The complete dataset is on Kaggle with over 13,000 games.

### Data Visualization and Analysis using Power BI

In this step, I utilized Power BI to create insightful dashboards based on the analyzed data. Through the interactive and dynamic capabilities of Power BI, I visually presented key metrics and trends related to shipment delays and supply vs demand. The data visualizations provided a clear overview of the shipment delay trend over time and highlighted any potential inefficiencies in the shipment process.

Additionally, I visualized the ratio between supply and demand for each product, helping to identify overstock or understock situations. These visualizations enabled a deeper understanding of the inventory management efficiency and highlighted opportunities for improvement.

For a more detailed exploration of the Power BI visualizations and analysis, kindly review the provided Power BI file within the repository.

## Insights, Recommedation & Conclusion
The trend analysis of Shipment Delay reveals significant insights for the period between January 2015 and December 2017. During this time, total of Shipment Delay exhibited a continuous upward trend. This indicates that the total number of delayed orders became increasingly closer to the total number of orders delivered on schedule. One significant insight revealed from the analysis is that customers located in the USA accounted for approximately 14.28% of the total shipment delays. This finding suggests that there may be specific challenges or bottlenecks in the shipping process for customers in this region that require attention.

To address this issue, it is recommended to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the root causes of the delays and implement proactive measures to improve efficiency and reduce the delays in the shipment process. Establish clear communication channels with suppliers and other stakeholders in the supply chain. Implement supply chain visibility tools and software to track inventory levels, shipment status, and potential disruptions. This increased transparency can help anticipate delays and facilitate proactive problem-solving. Finally, Just In Time must strengthen collaboration with logistics partners and warehouse facilities especially in the USA, Mexico, and France. Effective partnerships will facilitate smoother operations and faster order processing, reducing the chances of shipment delays. 

Based on the supply vs demand analysis, "Just In Time" has identified significant challenges in managing inventory for certain products. The presence of overstocked products like Bowflex SelectTech 1090 Dumbbells, Bushnell Pro X7 Jolt Slope Rangefinder, and Dell Laptop with hundreds supply but 0 demand suggests a need to review inventory management strategies and stimulate demand for these items. Reducing overstocked items should be a priority to avoid potential increase in inventory costs. Offering special discounts or bundle deals can be an effective strategy to incentivize customers to purchase these items and clear out excess inventory. With several marketing strategies, It will not only helps reduce overstocked items but also promotes customer engagement and increases the chances of repeat business.

On the other hand, products like Industrial Consumer Electronics, Total Gym 1400, and Lawn Mower face understock situations, indicating missed sales opportunities and customer dissatisfaction. To address these issues, the company should prioritize high-demand products, ensure steady supply, and implement demand forecasting for better inventory control. By focusing on these products, the company can allocate sufficient resources and ensure steady supply to meet customer demand. Additionally, "Just In Time" should establish strong partnerships with suppliers to secure a reliable and timely supply chain. Negotiating favorable terms with suppliers can help mitigate supply chain disruptions and ensure a consistent flow of inventory.
